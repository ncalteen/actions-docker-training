# Create and Use a GitHub Package

This exercise will walk you through the steps to create and use a package with
GitHub Packages. GitHub Packages supports a number of different package types,
and has separate registries for each.

| Language   | Package format     | Package client |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| JavaScript | `package.json`     | `npm`          |
| Ruby       | `Gemfile`          | `gem`          |
| Java       | `pom.xml`          | `mvn`          |
|            | `build.gradle`     | `gradle`       |
|            | `build.gradle.kts` | `gradle`       |
| .NET       | `nupkg`            | `dotnet`       |
| Docker     | `Dockerfile`       | `docker`       |

In this exercise, we will be using Ruby, so we will create a `.gemspec` file and
pushing a new Gem to the GitHub Packages registry.

1. Create a branch named `packages`

   ```bash
   git checkout -b packages
   ```

1. In the `.github/workflows/` directory, create a file named `package.yml` with
   the following contents

   ```yaml
   name: GitHub Package Registry

   on:
     # Start the workflow on push
     push:
       # Don't run on push to main
       branches-ignore:
         - 'main'

   jobs:
     # Build a Ruby gem
     build-gem:
       # Name the Job
       name: Build Ruby Gem

       # Set the platform to run on
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       # Define the steps
       steps:
         # Checkout the codebase
         - name: Checkout
           uses: actions/checkout@v3

         # Update the .gemspec file with the Gem name and version
         - name: Update .gemspec
           run: |
             sed -i "s/\[\[GEM_NAME\]\]/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/g" hello_world.gemspec
             sed -i "s/\[\[GEM_VERSION\]\]/${{ github.run_id }}/g" hello_world.gemspec
             cat hello_world.gemspec

         # Build the Gem
         - name: Build Gem
           run: gem build hello_world.gemspec

         # Authenticate to the GitHub Packages registry
         - name: Authenticate to GitHub Packages Registry
           run: |
             mkdir ~/.gem
             touch ~/.gem/credentials
             chmod 0600 ~/.gem/credentials
             echo ":github: Bearer ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" >> ~/.gem/credentials
             gem push --key github --host https://rubygems.pkg.github.com/${{ github.repository_owner }} ${{ github.event.repository.name }}-0.0.${{ github.run_id }}.gem
   ```

1. Commit the file

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Add RubyGem package workflow'
   ```

1. Open a pull request and merge the `packages` branch into the `main` branch,
   making sure to delete the `packages` branch after doing so

   In the pull request, you will see the _GitHub Package Registry / Build Ruby
   Gem_ job running and the results when it completes. You can review the logs
   of the run and the steps it took by selecting **Details** next to the action.
   You can experiment with this action by making additional updates to the code
   and committing it.

   If you would like to test installing the package you created, you can do so
   by following the instructions in the
   [RubyGems registry documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-rubygems-registry#installing-a-package).
